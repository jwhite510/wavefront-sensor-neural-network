test with squares or circles as the wavefront sensor

try photon counts with different numbers
	-- poisson noise
	-- gaussian noise at different levels
	-- use dark image for noise distribution

		-- add poisson noise first, then add gaussian noise

	-- use matlab code for interpolation of wavefront
